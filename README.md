Based on the data I observed Urban fares average lower than Suburban but more rides are needed. To further analyze the Urban locations would probably benefit from an increase in employees in these areas.
-By an overwhelming 62.7% Urban fares have the largest number of fares which is closely related to the total number of rides for Urban. This might have to do with the fact that in most urban setings a personal car isn't necessary. The short distanes make it lesdesirable to pay for the aspects of owning a vechicle vs ride share prices.
-With only 5% of rides coming from the rural type, its possible to also believe that most drivers can not fair being out that far for just a few trips. Its possible to make more trips and more money vs a couple trips for further distances.
-Looking at the other graphs, the small percentage of drivers from the rural area reflect the traveling distance from rural to urban. While it may be more pleasing to make more money, a rural driver might have to also commute that far for day-to-day work which could casue more wear and tear for a personal vechicle thus making the idea of ride sharing more expensive. If a person already resides in  the urban area it would also be easier to navigate a well known area too.
